# Auto Palette
A Blender addon that combines separate materials into a single material with palette textures. The output follows the metal/rough PBR workflow [compatible with glTF 2.0](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.80/addons/io_scene_gltf2.html#materials).

## Compatibility
Currently limited to use with Principled BSDF materials with unconnected input sockets.
